'''
Write a short Python function, minmax(data), that takes a sequence of
one or more numbers, and returns the smallest and largest numbers, in the
form of a tuple of length two. Do not use the built-in functions min or
max in implementing your solution.

def minmax(data):
    number = sorted(data)
    solution = (number[0], number[-1])
    return solution
